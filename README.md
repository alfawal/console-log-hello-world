# What is this?

A simple package that logs "Hello, World!" to the console.

The whole code is just one line:

```javascript
console.log("Hello, World!");
```

This package is used to test your imports and to see if you can import a package from a CDN or whatever you're trying to do.

## Usage

### CDN

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/@alfawal/console-log-hello-world/index.js"></script>
```

### Runtime

```bash
npm install @alfawal/console-log-hello-world
```

```javascript
require('@alfawal/console-log-hello-world');
```

ES6:

```javascript
import '@alfawal/console-log-hello-world';
```
